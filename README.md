### Instructions
- Please create a issue first and then attach that issue to the PR, so that every one know whatâ€™s the need of the PR. Attaching issues to the PR using github keywords, will close the issues once the PR is merged. More info [here]((https://help.github.com/en/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords)).

### Issue Guidelines

- Add default project `batch-8-NuSlack` to each of the Issue, so that it can be tracked in Projects Section. New Issue will be added as `Open` Issue in project.

### Git Branch Guidelines
- Create your own separate branch to work on new module or issue.
- Suggested branch name format is `username/label/#issue-id/goal-of-branch`.
- Checkout branch from `master` branch.
- To update branch from `master`, update master branch first, then in your branch run `git rebase master`.

```git
feat: subject of the commit in max 50 characters

description of the commit

Resolves: #issue-id
```
- Note one empty line after subject, and then again after description

### Git PR Guidelines
